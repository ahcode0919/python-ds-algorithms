## Arrays

* [First Duplicate](#first-duplicate)
* [First Not Repeating Character](#first-not-repeating-character)

#### First Duplicate

Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find
the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index.
In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for
which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of
the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.

```python
def firstDuplicate(a):
    uniqueSet = set()
    for value in a:
        if value in uniqueSet:
            return value
        else:
            uniqueSet.add(value)
    return -1
```

#### First Not Repeating Character

Note: Write a solution that only iterates over the string once and uses O(1) additional memory, since this is what you
would be asked to do during a real interview.

Given a string s, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character,
return '_'.


```python
def firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s):
    checkedChars = set() #skip characters we've already checked.
    for char in s:
        if char not in checkedChars and s.index(char) == s.rindex(char):
            return char
        checkedChars.add(char)
    return '_'
```
