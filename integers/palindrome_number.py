# Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: 121
# Output: true
# Example 2:
#
# Input: -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


def is_palindrome(a_string: int) -> bool:
    num = str(a_string)
    return num == num[::-1]
