## Jewels and Stones

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
Each character in S is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so 
"a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: `J = "aA"`, `S = "aAAbbbb"`
Output: `3`

```python
def jewels_and_stones(jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
    stone_count = dict()
    
    for stone in stones:
        if stone in stone_count:
            stone_count[stone] += 1
        else:
            stone_count[stone] = 1

    count = 0
    jewel_set = set(jewels)

    for jewel in jewel_set:
        if jewel in stone_count:
            count += stone_count[jewel]

    return count
```
