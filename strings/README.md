## Jewels and Stones

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
Each character in S is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so 
"a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: `J = "aA"`, `S = "aAAbbbb"`
Output: `3`

```python
def jewels_and_stones(jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
    stone_count = dict()
    
    for stone in stones:
        if stone in stone_count:
            stone_count[stone] += 1
        else:
            stone_count[stone] = 1

    count = 0
    jewel_set = set(jewels)

    for jewel in jewel_set:
        if jewel in stone_count:
            count += stone_count[jewel]

    return count
```

## Reverse String

Reverse a string

```python
def reverse_string(string: str) -> str:
    return string[::-1]


def reverse_string_with_list_comprehension(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([string[i] for i in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1)])


def reverse_string_with_loop(string: str) -> str:
    reversed_str: List[Optional[str]] = [None] * len(string)
    for index in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_str[len(string) - 1 - index] = string[index]
    return ''.join(reversed_str)
```
